I got suckered into learning vimscript because someone made a joke on Discord and I spent the evening screwing around with adding the current moonphase to Vim! Using the calculations from [moonphase.sh](https://github.com/kevinboone/moonphase.sh) by Kevin Boone. This is now my next step after "Hello, World!" when learning a language.

Executing `:source` in moonphase.vim will set your status bar to the current moonphase.

Next step: make it a plugin! Or make it integrate with vim-airline or something!
